/*
 * Description    : Equi joins two datasets, Customers and Orders, based on the customer id.
 *                  Given the 'indexnl' hint we expect the join to be transformed
 *                  into an indexed nested-loop join using Orders' secondary index.
 *                  Each branch (outer and inner) will be transformed as an index-only plan.
 *                  We also have a LIMIT. Each partition in the secondary index should only generate the number of tuples
 *                  that are equivalent to the LIMIT number. We call this "parameterizing the LIMIT".
 *                  We can trust the result of the secondary index-search since it executes a tryLock on PK.
 *                  There is an order-by and UNION_ALL operator can't enforce the original output order of the
 *                  first secondary index-search in the outer branch, "parameterizing LIMIT" can't be applied.
 * Success        : Yes
