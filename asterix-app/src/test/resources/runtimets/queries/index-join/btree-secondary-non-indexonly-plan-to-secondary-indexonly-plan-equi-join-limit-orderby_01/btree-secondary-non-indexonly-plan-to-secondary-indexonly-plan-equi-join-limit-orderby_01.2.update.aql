/*
 * Description    : Equi joins two datasets, Customers and Orders, based on the customer id.
 *                  Given the 'indexnl' hint we expect the join to be transformed
 *                  into an indexed nested-loop join using Orders' secondary index.
 *                  Inner branch will be transformed as an index-only plan.
 *                  Outer branch cannot be transformed as an index-only plan as an index can't cover
 *                  all search predicates even excluding the join condition.
 *                  We also have a LIMIT. Each partition in the secondary index of the inner branch should only
 *                  generate the number of tuples that are equivalent to the LIMIT number. We call this "parameterizing the LIMIT".
 *                  We can trust the result of the secondary index-search since it executes a tryLock on PK.
 *                  And the given order by attribute is consistent to the indexed attribute of the primary index-search in the outer branch.
 *                  In outer branch, result from a secondary index-search will sorted based on the PK of the outer branch.
 *                  Thus, "parameterizing the LIMIT" can be only applied to an order by with PK attribute of the outer branch.
 * Success        : Yes
