 *  Description     : Primary index search + LIMIT tests
 *                  : Unlike btree-index-limit-01 test, the where clause has multiple condition that can't be covered by
 *                  : the primardy index search alone. Thus, we can't pass LIMIT information to the index-search.
 *                  : That is, parameterizing LIMIT to the index-search is not possible.
 *  Expected Result : Success
