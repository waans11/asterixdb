 *  Description     : Secondary BTree Index non-index-only selection plan verification test
 *                  : This test is intended to verify that the secondary BTree index is used in the optimized query plan.
 *                  : In this plan, we fetch PK and non-SK field.
 *                  : The plan should look like this:
 *                  : unnest-map (secondary index look-up) -> sort -> unnest-map (primary index look-up) -> assign -> select -> ...
 *                  : While this is not an index-only plan, still it is better than a non-index only plan since
 *                  : this can reduces the number of verifications after the primary index search.
 *  Expected Result : Success
 *
