 *  Description     : Secondary full-text index reducing the number of verification selection plan test
 *                  : This test is intended to verify that the secondary full-text index is used in the optimized query plan.
 *                  : In this plan, we fetch PK and SK field. However, the given index doesn't contain the original SK field,
 *                  : this plan is not an index-only plan. Still, reducing the number of verification after the primary index-search
 *                  : is possible.
 *                  : The plan should look like this:
 *                  : unnest-map (secondary index look-up) -> sort -> unnest-map (primary index look-up) -> assign -> select -> ...
 *                  : We also have a LIMIT. Each partition in the secondary index should only generate the number of tuples
 *                  : that are equivalent to the LIMIT number. We call this "parameterizing the LIMIT".
 *  Expected Result : Success
