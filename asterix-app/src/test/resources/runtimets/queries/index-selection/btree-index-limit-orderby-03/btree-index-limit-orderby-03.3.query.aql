 *  Description     : Primary index search + Parameterize LIMIT information tests
 *					: Unlike the test-01, this test has an order-by clause that is not PK.
 *                  : So "parameterizing LIMIT information can't (shouldn't) work since we need to
 *                  : go through all search results to sort the result based on an another field.
 *                  : Therefore, the primary index search in each partition should generate all results.
 *  Expected Result : Success
