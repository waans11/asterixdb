/*
 * Description  : Test that left-outer-join may use an available primary index in the index subtree.
 *                In the probe side, this is a non index-only plan since a secondary index-search can't cover
 *                all fields that are required for the plan.
 *                We also have a LIMIT. However, none of index-searches can generate the final results since there are
 *                additional predicates that can't be replaced by an index-search.
 *                Thus, a LIMIT can't be applied on an index-search.
 * Expected Res : Success
