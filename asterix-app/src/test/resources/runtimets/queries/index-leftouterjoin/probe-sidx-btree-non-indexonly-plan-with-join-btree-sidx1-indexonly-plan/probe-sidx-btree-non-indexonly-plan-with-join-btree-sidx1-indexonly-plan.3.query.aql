 * Description  : Test that left-outer-join may use an available secondary index in the index subtree.
 *                In the probe side, this is a non index-only plan since a secondary index-search can't cover
 *                all fields that are required for the plan.
 *                In the inner branch, this is a index-only plan since a secondary index-search can cover
 *                all fields that are required for that branch.
 * Expected Res : Success
