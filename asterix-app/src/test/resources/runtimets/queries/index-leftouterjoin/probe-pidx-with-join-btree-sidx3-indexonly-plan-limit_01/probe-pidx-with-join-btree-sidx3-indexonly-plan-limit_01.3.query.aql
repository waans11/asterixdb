/*
 * Description  : Test that left-outer-join may use two available indexes, one for primary index in prob subtree and
 *                another for secondary index in index subtree. For inner branch, this is an index-only plan.
 *                We also have a LIMIT. Each partition in the primary index of the outer branch should only generate
 *                the number of tuples that are equivalent to the LIMIT number. We call this "parameterizing the LIMIT".
 * Expected Res : Success
