 * Description  : Create a feed dataset and a feed using the generic socket feed adapter.
                  To drive the socket adapter based feed, we define another feed using the
                  client socket test adapter. Content from the file is read by the test adapter
                  and forwarded to the socket feed adapter that is listening at a known socket.
                  At the end, data is collected in the dataset that was fed by the socket feed adapter.
                  Verify the existence of data in the dataset.

 * Expected Res : Success
 * Date         : 20th Nov 2013
